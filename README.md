# Trello-API-testing
SUMMARY
In this project, I will validate the basic features (create, update and delete cards) of a Trello board, using the APIs and the public Trello API documentation with the tool Postman to make actions with POST, PUT, DELETE methods in an automated way and verify results in the UI.
This following documentation is written the same way it would appear in Jira XRAY.
